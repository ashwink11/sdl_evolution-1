# POI Service Supported

* Proposal: [SDL-0276](0276-POI-Service-Supported.md)
* Author: [Shohei Kawano](https://github.com/Shohei-Kawano)
* Status: **Withdrawn**
* Impacted Platforms: [ Core / RPC ]

## Introduction

This proposal provides the function of sharing POI data between SDL Apps by `AppService`.  


## Motivation

Recently, IVI has moved from AVN (Audio & Visual Navigation) to DA (Display Audio).  
Therefore, when there is no Native Navigation, it is necessary to share POIs between SDL apps.  
The proposal of [SDL-0241 Commerce App Service](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_evolution/blob/master/proposals/0241-Commerce-App-Service.md) included a function to provide search data to other apps, but there was no specific use case and the function was excessive.  
In this proposal, only the minimum necessary POI exchange is provided for the App service. In the future, if someone wants to increase the data exchanged between apps, it is assumed that proposals and extensions will be made each time.  

***
[Assumed use case]
1. Launch POI app  
2. Search POI  
3. Show POI list  
4. Choose from POI list  
5. Set the chosen POI data to struct of `PoiServiceData->LocationDetails`  
6. Show popup message that is able to choose purpose from the following:  
 (a) Set as destination (Share the POI to SDL Navigation App)  
 (b) Call the phone number included in the POI  

When (a) is selected:
 7. If AppHMIType is "NAVIGATION", or if it is already LIMITED, go to (ii)10.  
 8. When there are multiple items including Native Navigation, popup is displayed.  
 9. Choose the Native Navigation or the app.  
  
  (i) When Native Navigation is selected.  
   10. Set POI to RPC `SendLocation->LocationDetails`.  
   11. Send RPC `SendLocation`  
   12. Show Native Navigation screen and find route.  
  
  (ii) When the SDL navigation app is selected or there is an app with `HMIStatus` already LIMITED.  
   10. Activate or change `HMIStatus` to FULL for the target SDL Navigation App  
   11. Subscribe to App Service from Navigation App  
   12. Navigation App gets `PoiServiceData->LocationDetails`.  
   13. Find route with Navigation App.  
  
When (b) is selected  
 7. Set `PoiServiceData->LocationDetails->phoneNumber` to RPC `DialNumber->number`.  
 8. Send `DialNumber`.  
 9. Start phone call.  
***
Since this proposal is a proposal for sharing POI data, it is assumed that Navigation App has already been started.  
So, navigation selection and specified Navigation App launch methods are not defined.  


## Proposed solution

Add new App Service Type for using this POI sharing method.  
  
Add POI element to AppServiceType enum of both Mobile API and HMI API.

Mobile API:
```xml
    <enum name="AppServiceType" platform="documentation" since="5.1">
         <element name = "MEDIA"/>
         <element name = "WEATHER"/>
         <element name = "NAVIGATION"/>
+        <element name = "POI"/>
    </enum>
```

HMI API:
```xml
    <enum name="AppServiceType">
         <element name="MEDIA"/>
         <element name="WEATHER"/>
         <element name="NAVIGATION"/>
+        <element name="POI"/>
    </enum>

```
The POI service is defined as a service that can provide searched information.  
As the information is to be provided, the name, coordinates, address, outline of the place, and telephone number of the searched place are assumed.  
This information matches the parameter of structure `Location Details` defined in the navigation.  

Mobile API (struct):
```xml

## Potential downsides

Nothing.  

## Impact on existing code

As new application services are added, Core needs new functionality implementation. It is also necessary to add parameters to RPC.

## Alternatives considered

A method to expand the RPC function to send and receive between App and Native, and to share information between Apps. 
However, a similar proposal is already rejected in [SDL-0130-SendLocation-for-Mobile-Nav](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_evolution/blob/master/proposals/0130-SendLocation-for-Mobile-Nav.md).
